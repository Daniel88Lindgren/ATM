Hereâ€™s a refined English translation:

The ATM system is designed for both users and admins. Each user logs in with a username and password. Once logged in, there is a menu with options for personal accounts, transactions, payments, admin (which is only accessible when an admin logs in with proper authorization), and an "easter egg - Don't click here."

Users can view transactions between their accounts, make payments with hardcoded bills, or transfer money between their own accounts.

Everything operates in-memory, so none of the actions are saved in the system. However, it would be fully capable of storing data in JSON or a database with CRUD functionality.

If you click on "Don't click here," you are "robbed" by the Beagle Boys, meaning all of your accounts are emptied.
